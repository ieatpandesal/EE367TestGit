In green Manoa Valley our Alma Mater stands
The flag of freedom beckons above her shining halls,
To larger truth and service our Alma Mater calls.

Hawai`i, we have gathered within thy wide-flung doors,
Our loyal priase we tender, and pledge to hold thy aim,
Till ocean's far horizons shall hear thy honored name.
